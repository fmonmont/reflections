When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote are useful to be able to collaborate online on a project with other users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You do not want to create conflicts with on-going work on the local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    a branch is created on the local repository. You clone a github remote to a local repository 
    or from a local repository to another repository. You fork a github remote onto my own github
    account.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
